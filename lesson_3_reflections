1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I need to share my projects with others for them to check out or work together.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I don't see anything wrong that Git automatically pull changes from a remote since my local repository is not public. I guess there is the same reason as manully commit and push changes, that is, making the user fully conscious they know and want these changes.
